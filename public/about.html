<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm YazhiniKarunanithi - a young web developer and proud B.Sc. graduate. 
  I've always believed in destiny. I once dreamt of becoming a doctor, but the universe had other plans for me. Funny enough, I used to hate computer sceince... and now, here I am - a passionate web developer!
  Today, I'm super happy with what to do. I love building websites, experimenting with modern web technologies, and creating designs exactly the way I imagine them. Web development has given me the freedom to turn my ideas into reality, and I enjoy every bit of it
</p>
<p>My Journey into web development started with curiosity- I wanted to know how websites actually work.Over time, 
  I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, and now I'm exploring frameworks to build modern applications.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring design trends,watching anime or experimenting with new recipes..haha!</p>
